SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A PowerShell module for Install Windows Patches, Upgrading VmTools, Upgrading VmHardware and Testing WSUS Client Settings on Remote Computers.

LONG DESCRIPTION   
    The following CmdLets are loaded in the current session when you import the module:

	Set-WindowsPatchingDefaults
	---------------------------
	Run this first.

	This cmdlet is used to set several defaults that are used by the other cmdlets and
	is needed for them to function. The only parameters that must be set for your 
	environment are the -vCenter and -UpdateServerURL. The rest are path related and
	will default to the USERPROFILE.

	The other parameters for paths that have defaults can be used to change the log,
	hostlist and results folder and file locations.

	This cmdlet can be ran after the module is imported with a shortcut or in your PowerShell
	profile script.

	EXAMPLE:
	$ENV:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

	# LOAD WINDOWSPATCHING MODULE
	$ModuleList = Get-Module -ListAvailable | Select -ExpandProperty Name
	If ($ModuleList -contains 'WindowsPatching') {
	     Import-Module –Name WindowsPatching
	}
	
	If ($ModuleList) {
	     Remove-Variable -Name ModuleList
	}
	
	# SET WINDOWS PATCHING DEFAULTS
	If ((Get-Module | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name | Out-String) -match "WindowsPatching") {
	     Set-WindowsPatchingDefaults -vCenter "vcenter01.domain.com" -UpdateServerURL "https://wsus01.domain.com" -Quiet
	}


	Test-WSUSClient
	---------------
	Use Test-WSUSClient to check a single host or multiple for the correct WSUS registry
	Settings for your environment.  

	Plus, it will force a GPO update and reregister with
	the WSUS server unless you use the switches to skip those tasks.


	Install-Patches
	---------------
	This is the main cmdlet to use after preparations are completed to install approved Windows patches,
	check/update Vmware tools, check/update Vmware VM hardware version.

	It can be used for a single host or multiple.
